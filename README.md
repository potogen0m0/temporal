(a game about time control)

this repository will probably not have much progress made now, as i am focusing on another project, but it will be made public to let you guys see it and stuff. this will also NOT include the main game, at least at the time of writing this, instead being only for the testing game, which will always be open-source. mark my words.

  You are on a walk to work, the eviction notice still fresh in your mind. You see a pocket watch on the ground in nearly perfect condition. It looks pretty valuable, which you need really bad right now, so you pick it up and look at the time.

  It has some weird markings on it which you haven't seen before, but it seems that the time is incorrect, and that the hands aren't actually moving. So, you try to calibrate it using the crown, thinking about fixing it later on. Big mistake.

  As you do this, you feel something is off. You look down, and see your body on the floor. Out of panic, you turn the crown to how it was originally, but now your body just isn't there. And also, you're trapped inside some fallen trees.

  One step at a time. You turn the crown, and the trees seem to be gone again. Weird. You do, in fact, think much of it. Is this some sort of cursed watch? Was it something someone put in that specific spot to get rid of you? Perhaps it was for someone else? Is this the only one? Are you some sort of ghost now? Can other people see you? Wheres the nearest restaurant?

  You can answer one of those right now. So, you go to Will's Diner.

  Its closed. They apparently closed 20 years ago. You were there 20 DAYS ago. Weird. The area is also way more progressed than you remember from literally yesterday. People are looking at you weird. Do you look weird? Did that watch mess up your appearance? Do they think you're dead? What did they think your cause of death was? Do you just look like yourself, which makes people confused because they saw you dead? Oh right, at least you know people can see you. Wait, can you talk? "Hello?" you said. Nice, you can talk. Wait, let me look in a mirror.

  You did that. You look like... a glowing humanoid? Like some lazy 3d render made by some lazy guy who happens to be oh so handsome and smart and funny and such a good person. Or, like, the opposite of all those last 4 qualities. Yeah, definitely the latter. Anyways, you don't have anything on your face. Except for a mouth. A simple mouth. Like the one you'd see on a stickfigure made in a drawing by a 1st grader. But better. As in, you can actually open it without it looking weird. And it's not 2d. Yeah, those people make sense. Also, you're really glowing. You should probably buy some clothes. Wait, are you immortal? Ah well, you don't want to roll 500 die trying to get the perfect score.

  You buy clothes. Your size hasn't changed which is nice. And you had grabbed your possessions, so thats nice. Good thing there was a self checkout. Though it said the date was 2062. Weird. Thought stuff would've progressed way more than it did. How many people are in the world now? How are other countries doing? Did World War III happen yet? What about IV? Are you still in a democracy? Who is the president if so? Could you have been arrested for public indecency? Well, in front of your hip you don't have anything, you know, specific... Do you need to eat?

  Anyways, you put on the clothes. The hoodie hides your face good enough. Nice. And no weird looks anymore. Also nice. Anyways... wait... what's that...
