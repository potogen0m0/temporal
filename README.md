### a game about time control

this repository will probably not have much progress made now, as i am focusing on another project, but it will be made public to let you guys see it and stuff.

  You are on a walk to work, the eviction notice still fresh in your mind. You see a pocket watch on the ground in nearly perfect condition. It looks pretty valuable, which you need really bad right now, so you pick it up and look at the time.

  It has some weird markings on it which you haven't seen before, but it seems that the time is incorrect, and that the hands aren't actually moving. So, you try to calibrate it using the crown, thinking about fixing it later on. Big mistake.

  As you do this, you feel something is off. You look down, and see your body on the floor. Out of panic, you turn the crown to how it was originally, but now your body just isn't there. And also, you're trapped inside some fallen trees.

  One step at a time. You turn the crown, and the trees seem to be gone again. Weird. You do, in fact, think much of it. Is this some sort of cursed watch? Was it something someone put in that specific spot to get rid of you? Perhaps it was for someone else? Is this the only one? Am I some sort of ghost now? Can other people see me? Wheres the nearest restaurant?

  You can answer one of those right now. So, you go to Will's Diner.

  Its closed. They apparently closed 20 years ago. You were there 20 DAYS ago. Weird. The area is also way more progressed than you remember from literally yesterday.
